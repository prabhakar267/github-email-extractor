## Manual installation

Due to a takedown from the Chrome Store you can only install this extension manually.

+ Clone the repo somewhere: `git clone https://github.com/prabhakar267/github-email-extractor.git`
+ Open: [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions)
+ (Activate developer mode in top right corner, if turned off)
+ Click `Load unpacked` button in top left corner
+ Select the `src` directory of this repo (which you cloned to your local system in step 1)



## How it works

+ Makes an API call to [github-email-extractor server](https://github.com/prabhakar267/github-email-extractor-server) with the GitHub username.
+ Server checks if there's an email ID for given username, else it parses all the GitHub acitvity for the user to get the email address.
